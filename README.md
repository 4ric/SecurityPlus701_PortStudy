If you are stuggling to learn the key ports required for CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 exam, this script might be helpful.

What it does?
It either asks you to provide a port number or a protocol name as the first question and the transport method as a second question.

What is the answer format?
If protocol can operate on both TCP and UDP, the correct answer will be "TCP,UDP". If you are asked about FTP ports, the correct answer will be "20,21".

It has 58 total questions that are randomised, 29 asking for port number and 29 asking for protocol name.

Code is not perfect but it helped me learn protocols, hope it will be useful for someone.
